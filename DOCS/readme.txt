Full Description
----------------
QuickMotion is an OS/2 Multimedia component that plays QuickTime, QuickTime VR (QuickMotion 2.0 and higher) and Windows-style AVI movies. QuickMotion can do this because it contains a complete QuickTime engine, with support for all the most popular video and audio decompressors (Indeo, Cinema, Animation, IMA, etc.). Version 2.0 adds support for Virtual Reality objects and single- and multi-node panoramas.

QuickMotion works under the expandable OS/2 Multimedia architecture. With QuickMotion, any native OS/2 application that can play OS/2-style AVI movies can also play QuickTime movies and Windows-style AVI movies.

Some examples of native OS/2 movie applications are the Workplace Shell components that appear in the Open As... menu for movie files, Video In, the QuickFlick movie player applications and the QuickFlick plugin for Netscape.

It's easy to use QuickMotion because it integrates seamlessly with OS/2 multimedia, and works behind the scenes to add playback support for a great many types of QuickTime and Windows-style AVI movies. To use QuickMotion, simply open the movie using your 32-bit OS/2 Multimedia application of choice.

Tip: When you choose Open... in some applications, they may list only *.AVI files. Remove the *.AVI selection in order to list all files, including QuickTime movies.
